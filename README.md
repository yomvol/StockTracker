This pet project has been been intended to hone and demonstrate my C# skills. It`s made on WPF framework. The core idea of the app is to get historical data on Moscow Exchange securities from the web server and present it with plot and table. Due to the unrighteous war and demise of MOEX the project has been frozen. In the current version code related to downloading via MOEX API is commented out, bizzare behavior of the XML parser leads to q weird pattern on the plot. Though condition of the app is miserable, nevertheless I`m bound to mention the WPF techniques and patterns used: MVVM, INotifyPropertyChanged, Binding, Oxyplot library, events, memomy-mapped files and XML reading.
